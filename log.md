# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 13, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Baby steps learning NodeJS with FreeCodeCamp & Grafikart.

**Thoughts:** First steps learning NodeJS with ```learnyounode``` and Grafikart (on YouTube). I'm struggling but I'm going slowly, I need to practice Javascript more & more.

**Link to work:** [A ```cat file | wc -l``` like program for #learnyounode (Asynch version)](https://gist.github.com/Fcmam5/d3eb594ec7ac41fb962c6c5877b12c7c)
